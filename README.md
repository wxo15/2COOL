# 2COOL

Stanford online course of CS143 Compilers: [edX](https://www.edx.org/course/compilers) and [stanford.edu](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/)

## Introduction

The full name of "Cool" is "The Classroom Object-Oriented Language". It is a small language designed for use in an undergraduate compiler course project by Stanford University. Cool has many of the features of modern programming languages, including objects, automatic memory management, and strong static typing. It generates code for a MIPS simulator.

Useful documents:

* [The Cool Reference Manual](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs143/materials/cool-manual.pdf)
* [Flex Manual](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~cr4bd/flex-manual/index.html) - Lexer generator
* [Bison Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bison/manual/bison.html) - Parser generator

## Installing & Setup

There are two ways to configure the environment. One is to use the provided pre-configured Linux system via VirtualBox VM, the other is to install directly on your own installation of Linux (Debian-based system required). I have a Linux-Window dual boot on my laptop, so the second method was used.
